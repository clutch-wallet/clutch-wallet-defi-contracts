**Clutch Wallet DeFi Contract** is designed for precise DeFi portfolio accounting. To put it simply, DeFi SDK is the on-chain *balanceOf* for DeFi protocols.

## Features

#### üí•Query user assets and debt deposited in DeFi protocols like *Maker, Aave, dYdX*, etc. 
> How much debt does `0xdead..beef` have on Compound?
#### üìäGet the underlying components of complex derivative ERC20 tokens 
> How much `cUSDC` vs `ETH` does `ETHMACOAPY` have?
#### ‚ú®Interact with multiple DeFi protocols in a unified way (coming soon)

## DeFi SDK Architecture

- **ProtocolAdapter** is a special contract for every protocol. Its main purpose is to wrap all the protocol interactions.
There are different types of protocol adapters: "Asset" adapter returns the amount of the account's tokens held on the protocol and the "Debt" adapter returns the amount of the account's debt to the protocol. Some protocols do not use "simple" ERC20 tokens but instead have complex derivatives, for example the Compound protocol has CTokens. The **ProtocolAdapter** contract also provides information about the type of tokens used within it.
- **TokenAdapter** is a contract for every derivative token type (e.g cTokens, aTokens, yTokens, etc.)
Its main purpose is to provide ERC20-style token metadata as well as information about the underlying ERC20 tokens (like DAI for cDAI). Namely, it provides addresses, types and rates of underlying tokens.
- **AdapterRegistry** is a contract that a) maintains a list of *ProtocolAdapters* and *TokenAdapters* and b) is called to fetch user balances.

More detailed documentation about contracts can be found in [adapters](../../wiki/Adapters) and [AdapterRegistry](../../wiki/AdapterRegistry) documentation.

## How to Add Your Adapter

The full instructions on how to add a custom adapter to the **AdapterRegistry** contract may be found in our [wiki](../../wiki/Adding-new-adapters).

## What‚Äôs Next for DeFi SDK? üöÄ

This first version of DeFi SDK is for read-only accounting purposes. Our next step is to introduce Interactive Adapters that allow users to make cross-protocol transactions from a single interface. We are incredibly excited to work with developers, users and the wider DeFi community to make these integrations as secure and accessible as possible. Watch this space, because the ‚ÄúDe‚Äù in DeFi is about to get a whole lot more user-friendly!

## Security Vulnerabilities üõ°

If you discover a security vulnerability within DeFi SDK, please send us an e-mail at contact@clutchwallet.xyz. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Dev Notes

This project uses Truffle and web3js for all Ethereum interactions and testing.
